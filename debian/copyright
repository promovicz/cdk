 Calling this script install-sh is preferred over install.sh, to prevent
 `make' implicit rules from creating a file called install from it
 when there is no Makefile.
 .
 This script is compatible with the BSD install script, but was written
 from scratch.  It can only install one file at a time, a restriction
 shared with many OS's install programs.
